# Angular- Tour Of Heroes

This is my version of the Angular Tour of Heroes walkthrough.

I decided to base mine off their instructions, but used AngularCLI and based
mine on LEGO characters, hence the name Tour Of Legos.

These are the steps I've followed so far.
1. Install AngularCLI

   You can follow the steps here
   
   https://github.com/angular/angular-cli#installation
   
   or if you're comfortable with the command line and already have Node 6.9.0 or higher, together with NPM 3 or
  higher, you can simply `npm install -g @angular/cli`
2. Now you'll begin to follow the Tour Of Heroes walkthrough from here

   Skip down to the "Show the Hero" section
